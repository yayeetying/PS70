              <hr> <!-- Adds horizontal line -->

              <p> 
                For my kinetic sculpture, I wanted to do a mini conveyor belt
                because one of my final project idea used a conveyor belt,
                and I wanted to see how doable it was to create this. But I ran into
                a lot more trouble than I realized I would've :( (or maybe I'm just
                not very good at making things with my hands) <br> <br>

                Let me start with my finished product! <br>
                <video width="640" height="480" controls>
                    <source src="https://yayeetying.github.io/PS70/video/conveyorbelt1.mov" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
              <br> <br>

              As you can see above, I used a straw as my belt's inner portion, 
              but this straw's hole didn't quite attach to the motor's stick. To fix this,
              I tried laser cutting a piece that had the motor's shape on one side and 
              the straw's shape on the other, but this idea didn't quite work because 
              the cardboard was flimsy, and the fit between the 2 wasn't tight enough.
              So I scrapped this idea and decided to use heat shrink to connect the 2.
              It was this night that I learned how to use a heat gun (and to wait before
              touching anything that was just heat-gunned, which, in hindsight, duh TT) <br> <br>

              Anyway, here's another part that I struggled with. The model was originally
              very flimsy, as in the motion from the motor would make the pieces start to fall 
              apart because they weren't really connected in any way. So I thought of glueing
              the pieces together to make them more connected, which worked! -- at the expense
              of the actual conveyor belt itself. You see, I didn't realize that glueing the 
              straw with the inner spinning cylinder would make it so that the cylinder wouldn't
              spin anymore, therefore making the conveyor belt stop spinning. It was too late 
              when I realized this, so I had to recreate the entire cylinder parts and connect 
              them to new straws. <br> <br>

              Anyway, this belt is nowhere near perfect, because 1) it's a little jonky 
              when rolling the belt because the belt isn't completely smooth (the little pieces 
              of tape make it stuck when spinning sometimes). The parts are also not connected 
              very well, so I need to physically hold the pieces when the motor is running. But 
              this is genuinely one of the first projects I made by myself with my hands from 
              start to finish, so I'm proud of it.
