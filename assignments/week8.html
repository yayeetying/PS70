              <p> For this week, I was thinking about how working with water and plants ends up making a mess everytime 
                because the water drained down the pot just goes on the table. To solve this, I wanted to make a plate for
                this plant out of wood, and laser cutting that wooden middle piece out wouldn't work since I wanted to take a
                shape out of this wooden cylinder. This meant this would be the perfect job for the CNC machine!
              </p> <br>
              <a href="flowerbase.f3d">Here</a> is my CAD file. <br> <br>
              And here is how it turned out after cutting it in the CNC machine! <br>

              <img src="../images/cncwithplant.jpeg" alt="CNC With Plant" class="iconPic"> <br> <br>

              <p> During this process, I messed up quite a few times and had to recruit help from Jessica and Bobby.
                For example, some parts of the wood was warped upwards, making it really hard to airgun the piece of wood down!
                I also learned about the importance of practice running on top of the wood the CNC cut operation.
