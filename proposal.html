                    <p> 
                        This is essentially an automated irrigation system. By placing the soil moisture sensor and the tube 
                        connected to the water pump in the same pot as the flower pot you want to irrigate, you can ensure
                        that whenever the moisture sensor deems that the flower isn't receiving enough water, it will 
                        automatically make the water pump start pumping out water till the soil is wet enough. The LED light 
                        serves as an indicator as to whether the plant is "happy" or not (received enough water) -- if the 
                        plant is happily irrigated, the LED light will randomly flash any colors, but if it isn't well watered,
                        then the LED light will stop. One thing to note is that Bobby helped me fix the issue of the water pump 
                        not stopping once it started by giving me a piece (I forget what it's called).
                    </p> <br>
                    Here is the code for controlling the input soil moisture sensor, the output LED light, and the output 
                    water pump. <br>

                    <h3><b>Flower Preservation!</b></h3>
                    <hr> <!-- Adds horizontal line -->

                    <p>
                        While I was in Japan this summer, I developed a habit of gifting friends
                        bouquets of flowers, because flowers there were so beautiful and inexpensive.
                        Lo and behold, my friends started calling me a flower child! And giving
                        back little bouquets of flowers, which would make me so, so happy until the petals
                        would start wilting and dying. This idea is therefore inspired by my desire
                        to preserve these beautiful flower petals. <br> <br>

                        This idea is like an <b>automated flower bookmark maker</b>. Manually, 
                        bookmarks can be made by taking a sheet of contact paper, placing dried 
                        flower petals on the adhesive portion of it, and then placing another
                        sheet of contact paper on top of it. In the best case scenario, this machine 
                        is able to automate this entire process on a conveyor belt. On the leftmost
                        side of the belt, there would be a mold to place the contact paper. The conveyor 
                        belt would then move this sheet to the flower station, where places of no 
                        color (and therefore no petals) would be detected and populated with petals on top.
                        Then, the conveyor belt would continue to the right, where another sheet of
                        contact paper is placed on top of the finished product.

                <hr> <!-- Adds horizontal line -->

                <p>
                    This next idea is a <b>lamp in the shape of Pikachu</b> (very fitting, I think!)
                    This 3D-printed(?) Pikachu is hollow on the inside so some sort of
                    light can fit inside the body. Then, depending on what time of day
                    it is, Pikachu lights up with different brightness intensities. For
                    example, during sleep hours, Pikachu has no light, whereas during 
                    study hours, Pikachu shines the brightest. The user can input 
                    when these "hours" (sleep hours, study hours, etc.) are on a separate 
                    website.

                        out of 4 emotions (or so) and touch what emotion they are feeling 
                        (ie. happy, or sad, or nostalgic). Then, depending on what emotion 
                        they touched, different corresponding photos show up on the frame.
